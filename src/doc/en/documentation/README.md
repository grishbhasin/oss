### Welcome to OpenSearchServer!

Integrating OpenSearchServer (OSS) as a search engine can be done within minutes.

This wiki documents the process and is constantly being updated, fixed and polished. All constructive contributions are of course welcome!

The main content areas are:
* a series of quick-start guides teaching the basics,
* the documentation proper with more in-depths resources.
