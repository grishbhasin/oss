## How to reset a forgotten username or password

If you forgot your user name, or your password (or both!), do the following:

1. Close the Tomcat server by closing the cmd prompt window.
2. Browse to the OpenSearchServer directory and locate the `data` folder.
3. Open the data folder; locate and delete `users.xml`.
4. Restart OpenSearchServer by double-clicking on `start.bat` (on Windows) or running `start.sh` (on Unix) .
